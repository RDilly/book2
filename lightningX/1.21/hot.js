// 1. Define an array that has the words of a sentence as its items.
// 2. Define a function that accepts an array of words.
// 3. The responsibility of the function is to build a sentence, as a single string, from the array of words and return it.
// 4. Pass your array to the function as an argument value.






// 1. Define a function that accepts a single string as an argument.
// 2. The responsibility of the function is to return a boolean (true/false) if the sentence has a odd number of words in it.
// 3. Take the return value of the first function, and pass it to the second.
// 4. `console.log()` the result of the second function

// Example:
// "The sentence has an even number of words"
// or 
// "The sentence has an odd number of words"
